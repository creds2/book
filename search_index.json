It is scattered across thousands of websites, data files, minds and academic papers, making it nigh on impossible for the everyday person to make sense of the current situation, let alone decide the best course of action based on a realistic assessment of future possibilities and constraints. In the realm of energy policy, wishful thinking dominates. This book aims to reset the debate, to make it more evidence based, up-to-date and grounded in the latest research. To some extent it is a “public engagement in science” project: it will be publicly available, written in a publicly accessible style and, hopefully, popular in print and online forms. However, the primary target audience is decision makers across the UK who need to much better informed about what can work, and what cannot, in order to succeed in out collective commitment to decarbonise the economy by 2050, an unprecedented challenge which must rely on the latest research if it to succeed. It will have the following features: Collaborative, with a range of researcher, centred on the CREDS project, contributing content Comprehensive, covering all major aspects of the energy question, from supply to ‘demand’ and buildings to transport Cohesive, with a consistent style, branding and messaging across chapters, unlike most books authored by multiple academics Open, with the source code available for others to contribute, allowing the project to evolve as the evidence base grows. Draft structure Energy is a complex topic. A clear structure will help make sense of the complexity, making structure an important aspect the book. There are many ways of structuring the book, and this can be decided later down the line, but it is worth highlighing some options: By sector, e.g. buildings, transport, materials and products. By the CREDS themes, Buildings &amp; Energy Digital Society Flexibility Materials &amp; Products Policy &amp; Governance Transport &amp; Mobility The energy hierarchy: the concept of the energy hierarchy, which states that energy policies should follow an order of prioritisation, including Reducing the need for energy using services, e.g. travelling less Increasing the efficiency of existing energy conerters Replacing fossil fueled electricity generation with renewable energy converters By timescale: from technologies and policies that are currently in use towards more ‘blue skies’ options "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

["how-it-would-work.html", "Chapter 2 How it would work", " Chapter 2 How it would work A ‘core book team’ of CREDS, with one representative from each theme, would compile key content in a draft working document. A professional writing, with oversight from the core book team, would write-up the state of play, and scenarios for change, into a single narrative. The source code of the book and prose would be made available via a code sharing platform such as GitHub and all CREDS members would be encouraged to contribute via ‘pull requests’, to be reviewed by at least one other CREDS member and the professional writer. The book would be open and publicly available from the beginning. A ‘call for contributions’ would go out, inviting expert inputs. These would require 2 reviews before being accepted, in a process of open and transparent peer review. This open model would enable educational benefits to begin from the book’s inception. There would be a deadline (e.g. of 12 months) after which ‘V1’ would be published as a physical book. Any profit/royalties would go back into CREDS engagement exercises. After publication the book would live on "],
